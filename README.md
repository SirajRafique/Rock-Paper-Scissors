# Rock Paper Scissors

## Introduction 

Welcome to my third project. A text based game, written completely in python for people of all ages.  

This is a classic game of rock, paper and scissors. The aim is to use logical considerations, compete and try to win against the computer.    

The command-line application has been deployed to a cloud-based platform.

When passing the code through PEP8 the above error showed. 
This has now been fixed. I moved the code to a new line.
